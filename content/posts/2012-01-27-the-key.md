I wish I had the key to every opening!

I wish the stars would reach to me for every need!

The sand would then become my slave

Build castles in the blistering wind,

raise mountains from the troubled sea

and slowly reach the dreams within

and slowly earn …

and than would you be safe? would…

I be safe? would we?
