So! I think it’s time I quit talking babbles; even though

I’m pretty sure that every word I’m saying is like

an open book to you; like you are to me when I’m around you

It’s time I put this in the words of a man; not a lover

not a story teller; not a boy and certainly not a poet –

Poets are shallow these days… natural deceivers

So I’ll try to put this story in my own words.

\_There’s not a moment going by, that I don’t think of you

That I try to put my thoughts in order, yet you are

the only link to my sanity – You give me a quiet mind and I…\_

No, I was never good at defining this feeling

All I know is that, the vision of our glass of wine is

as peaceful as taking a glimpse at the stars and

as warm as all the fires of the world gathered up in one sun

And that every time I think of, the world narrows

\_I dreamt I kissed you; and it was like getting bourn again

So sweet that I could feel the shivers in the tip of my fingers…\_

I know! I know it is just a dream, but that doesn’t deprive

me from the right to hope – And I hope! I hope and I wish

so hard that I could crush the stars with only one word;

but this power will not; will never apply on will…

I’ve wondered so much what I should do to win you,

you heart, your soul, your essence – the light of this

is too violent, too unstable and I cannot control it.

When I’m around you, I lose myself… I’m like a little boy

always wanting to play; always growling; always unable to

find his own words! So I’ve decided to leave myself for a while

get back to the points of origin; back to my world hidden

in plain sight. And I will look upon myself and grow…

So… you can say I’m going back to the stars; but not alone

I’m gonna take with me every little thought – every

little dream I have about you; about me not knowing what

I want about you, for you, for us…

I do not want to ask again if you think or _will_ think of me

I wish you do! i would be such a fool man to say that I don’t

And if you’ll miss me, just light a candle; let it

wear your whispers to my ears… or maybe send a rose
