Dudes, I’ve just discovered that Mendeleev’s periodical table is totally overrated! Yes… a new periodical table has been discovered!

Behold! <a href="http://code.google.com/more/table/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOOGLE’s PERIODICAL TABLE</a>!

Now… leaving the jokes behind, the idea is very good. +1 point to Google for thinking out smart. It’s very easy now, to discover their APIs without too much trouble.
