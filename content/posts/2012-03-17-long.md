It’s been so long since we’ve been able to talk;

So long that I _wonder_ yet again what you see in front of you

I even realized that I was aiming  too high and

that the perfume from your hands, now laying on mine,

its almost like a bless – such a small _gift_ for a crazy man

It’s been so long since the first glass of wine,

or the glass of coke, or… since the world, as I see now

Yet there’s one _world_, one small _universe_, I’m still so far from

and I’m almost frightened I will never get to _know_

_Only if for one night…_

I feel the stars are falling and I am falling also,

since stars were my last home, my… meditation \_refuge

_ I’m actually giving it up – for other souls to take it \_over_

I know now that this world has reached as far as it could get –

And the refuge I need is right here… so close… _closer_,

and yet, _so_ far…

But I’m not giving up! I will fight! I want to fight for!

I’m hiding between words and babbles and nonsense;

and words are easy to follow, yet do you see?

Will you _see_ where I fail again and again, to discover…

Will you show? Will you open this _world_ to me?

I stay again, in front of _you_, waiting; A _wanderer_

in search for a _universal_ key… I dare not to ask again

_What do you see?  _

\_ I hope…

But most of all, I crave… \_
