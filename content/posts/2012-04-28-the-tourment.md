The staying away! Not speaking…. Not telling how my heart jumps whenever…

I wish I could scream it! And yes, I’m so selfish! I say I and I again

and again! Not asking… Not daring to think

Not wanting to know the already obvious answer…

A thousand moons! An army of demons… the soul of a wolf

No curse… no magic stronger than the heart of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">another</span>

The waltz has no purpose! The march lost its meaning

It only remains in the form of a nightmare

The pain that will never heal but will be forgotten…

And yet the dream! The tourmenting of the sweetness

The almost kiss, the taste, the softness! The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shiver</span> …

And then the wake up… The almost touch of the skin…

The scent… the perfume left on my hands…

Craziness! Madness…. Tourment… Pain! Yet I am happy!

_I feel_! Trapped, not wishing for an escape; For there is but one…

Happiness is useless if not shared…
