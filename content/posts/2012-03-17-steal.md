l know I’ve told you that for this next poem

l’m waiting for the right music;

Well… I haven’t found it. It seems l am unable

To feel other music than the one you

Somehow manage to feed me

No matter how far you are…

l wonder… If I’ll try to steall from you

This precious gift I crave so much for

l wonder… Will l ever have the courage

To try and touch your lips

A dream of the fools…

I’m afraid of falling… I think;

And in your own way so are you!

But somehow I feel I already fell

And thus I search for… a way to tell

But I fear… I fear no magic has ever

been born without a price…

Yet _I am happy to pay!_
