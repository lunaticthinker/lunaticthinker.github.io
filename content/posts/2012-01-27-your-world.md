I’ve never been to your world –

the pages I have; they’re so few…

Would be a bless to learn of

Your blossom in this rose’s garden

Though time there is, I start to wonder;

descending near you – leaving

my endless world of nonsense…

Would ever help in growing a new path

Leave  to the new… never forget the old,

keep all the treasures to your soul

I’m was the watcher bid to see –

I dared to glimpse into your world –

I dared… I thought I would…

For so long, this rose appeared before me

So many times, so many shapes

Each time it grew more beautiful

that I could ever cherish it

Each time I was away

What right I have to…

I’ve never been to your world –

So little I know from my outpost

from the dark sea of the mind

The sky, it should remain untouched!

May never get to be in your world…
