If only I could crawl into this heart

Make it a home! make it a heaven…

I crave it… I _crave_ it! desire… and,

the most, I humbly fear _this_…

If I can’t have… than may the night

be cold! Forever dark, and darker moons…

I do not dare to break this world of yours

Could it be understood; never to see…

Yet every moment seems another drop

A cup of venom; this _snake_ is drowning

every little part – the ever wondering soul…

Pick up the glass! Observer, don’t let this fade

see if it’s worthy of your heart! See if this worlds

collided will give birth to other stars and _dream_!

I gladly stay! I’m opened! So cut _it_ open

if this would satisfy the need to know!

And I would drink this cup of venom; gladly!

If happines would bring to; yet even death

She’s weak! She has no powers over

The _dreams_ I bear for this white rose…

\_Forever sealed the lips until the day

a kiss would break the word and set it free…

Would you, observer, be the one? \_
