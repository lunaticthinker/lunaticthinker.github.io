To meet again; to feel the bare scent of her skin

I’d beg today – even pretend to close my lips to …

I pray there be a day when I will feast

and feel the shivering taste;

her wondrous neck…

I dream to barely touch; to steal…

A thief I am… I should be; so call me thief –

for there I am, always in front of you;

stealing the things you would not cede

the smallest gaze –

the almost touch –

the presence!

I dare not show, nor tell again!

But hope… I hope… I dream…
