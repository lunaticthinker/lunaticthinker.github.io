With every page I read, the chills are turning back

Stronger and stronger, like every little word

Is yet another key, another door, another stack;

new wonders  to discover, new wanderings to sort

It feels so peaceful in this pages; the stories of a boy and a girl

yet to discover the paths of the light of the moon

The story of the sky and the sea

of forever…
