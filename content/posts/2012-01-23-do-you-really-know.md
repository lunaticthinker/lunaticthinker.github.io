I’m nothing but the watcher bid to see; never to touch!

I’m nothing but the child never to live nor tell his tales!

Not yet his time! NOT yet his time…

NOT YET the time…

There is no world where I could hide the gaze of green!

There is no world where I could hide…

You know! It terrifies me that you know; it’s not the time…

NOT YET the time…

The pages have been written still…

I crave the touch… I crave the kiss… I CRAVE the soul…

So close to the edge of your skin… so far… so far… SO FAR!

Forever wondering soul… Not yet the time…

Yet do you really know?
