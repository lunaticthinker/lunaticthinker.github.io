Sing me to sleep, sing me to sleep

I’ve lived so many times this storyteller’s tale;

And every time it ended in the same

and it became the song of grief

So I became the storyteller;

Picked up some stars and shards and

wrapped them into tales so strong

That no one dared to challenge

But in between I’ve lost the one thing

I could treasure most; Forgot to feel…

So I began to search the world;

To find a friend – I found much more

I felt again! The storyteller lost his tales

And then became a tale himself (again)

Yet he could never share this wonder

since what he felt was overcome by fear…

I fear you, and all you’re throwing into me,

this dying soul; reckoning of an old shape

And wonder if you could become the muse

And maybe this time, the tale won’t end…

But until then… sing me to sleep…

Coz’ sleep will keep the world from spinning!
