I wonder which of you I desire more –

the one who struggles till the bitter end;

she who fights alone to bear an entire world

Or the dreamy girl, beyond all that –

the one I always see, but hidden beyond

the great and darken fortress walls…

And only with the corner of the eye –

The truth is I desire you both

I wonder why I reject any other
