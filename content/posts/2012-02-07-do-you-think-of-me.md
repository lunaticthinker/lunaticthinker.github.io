you give me a quiet mind

and I… I…

Do you think of me?

I kissed her on the cheek today

And she smiled; I feel like a child!

My heart gives me chills; I have butterflies –

there’s a light at the end of the dark

and it’s the smell of her skin

Do you think of me?

Forgive the roses my love; you said

Sometimes they are beautiful –

Sometimes they sting

All beauty can kill; I replied in my head;

yet I was ready to bleed in her arms;

No matter the thorns or the pain –

She’s like no other rose I have seen

And roses bleed too
