I wonder which of you I desire more –

the one who struggles till the bitter end;

she fights alone to bear an entire world

Or this dreamy girl, beyond all that –

one I always see, but hidden beyond

the great and darken fortress walls…

and only with the corner of the eye –

The truth is I desire both – No matter which one

plays the hide and seek game with the other.

I wonder why I why I dream so much

of the sight of you in the morning –

Guess it’s just the spell you threw over me

while I imagined the taste of your lips

Or just the curse I gain while wondering alone,

exploring the roots of your soul

I dared reaching my hand to feel you,

Yet it was my only hand – my balance.

So I fell. <span style="color: #ffffff;">I’m falling for you…</span>
