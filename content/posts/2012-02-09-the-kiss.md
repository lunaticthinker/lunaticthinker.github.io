he’s waited so long for this kiss, a carnage

A feast between the dark and the holy

Each craving for the battle within

So he took her closer and closer,

grabbing her back with his claws;

cutting her flesh with his nails –

And he bit her neck till It drew blood

Such a feast in his thoughts

yet nothing but a small. sigh…

So many armies prepared;

His wolves were ready to feast –

Yet he waited. Got close to her lips –

“I’ve waited so long for this kiss” –

And nothing was more sweet,

more shivering than the touch

of his lips over hers…

And than the silence. The wolves

could feed now.
