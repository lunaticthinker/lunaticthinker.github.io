He dreamt he rose her in his arms

Sorounded by the blossom trees

Her eyes were raining happiness

And she was gazing so in love…

He dreamt the passion of a kiss

A moment longer than Forever

yet this was all a dream of wine

And none of this would be…

The ice is always thin over this water

The flow has never stoped to run

I’d go with YOU; I’ll drown with YOU

if this Must be my path to give!

This is nevertheless your river…
