are you the one?; the only soul I’d lay my head on – tell my tale

love letters sent to all the stars; I picked the moon – (green eyes and an) apple of sin

I wish I were the whispers on your lips; the shivers of you touch

nightingale – no music needed while around you, since

all I feel is music; you’re but the muse desired – never reached and craved…

and all I fear can be hidden in your heart; this long craved home

lying in all the words, and all the deeds; and all the unseen longings

I wish I were your morning smile; your radiating warmth while waking up –

nevertheless a dream is nothing but a dream – a question with no answer

are you the one?; the only soul I’d lay my heart on – give my life
