And why in the world would you want him

You do not need to fight for his love

you do not have to fight for him

He’ll always be there in the shadow

Waiting for you! Will he?

So go on! Have fun! Waiste yourself

Among the the first bourn of the demons

Play With the light of your blue eyes

Play! Play! Give yourself to the world!

What would there be more beautiful

Than loosing yourself in the waltz

of the rivers of lust…

what would be more beautiful than

the cry of the one left to tell the tale!

the death of the storyteller
