_Will you marry me?_

She started packing things along the room;

While he was waiting on his knees

He thought he’ll never see her smile again

Got scared; than horrified he’d loose her –

So time was given for a choice – no repent

And then, when he’d expect it less

He saw the ring onto her hand – so shiny

Yet happy he was not; he also saw the end

Two thousand moons after that day…

He saw the wolves rising in armies

And demons walzing to his end!

He hoped he’d stop thad day from coming

But wrong he was… So wrong…

And so the day of ashes came – a day of beasts

So he gave up from hoping; took his nails

The wolves did not attack him though;

The demons gave him wine to drink –

And they all bowed into one question – ‘_my king?_‘ –

and then the world had opened to the beast
